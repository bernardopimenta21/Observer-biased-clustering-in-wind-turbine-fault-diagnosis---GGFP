# Observer-biased-clustering-in-wind-turbine-fault-diagnosis---GGFP

 Over the last two decades wind power has undergone an exponential growth globally. 
 As the demand for wind power systems increases, efficiency is sought to be maximized and operation and maintenance costs reduced. Condition monitoring (CM) systems have become a field of high interest in this industry.
 
 The main components of wind turbines constitute the focus of CM, they are responsible for frequent, large repair costs and operational downtime. Within the main components, the gearbox accounts for one of the highest failure rates and is the component that causes the greatest amount of downtime.
 The focus is on the application of fuzzy clustering for wind turbine gearboxes fault diagnosis. 
 
 The Gath-Geva clustering algorithm is explored by applying the observer biased clustering framework. The notion of an observer allows clustering to be an interactive process, providing an intuitive way to control cluster formation and enabling domain knowledge to be incorporated in the process. 
 A domain expert can choose the level of granularity and is able to select a particular region of the data space for a detailed view. The Gath-Geva with Focal Point algorithm is tested with wind turbine gearbox vibrational data and compared with its unbiased version, the Fuzzy C-Means biased and unbiased algorithms. 
 
 Two metrics are employed to validate internal clustering: the Xie-Beni index and Kim-Lee index, the latter of which is based on relative degree of sharing. The algorithms are compared by performing several independent runs and using the distribution of the Adjusted Rand Index external validation metric.
